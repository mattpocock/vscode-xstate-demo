This could result in false positive "Some implementations missing" error.

- Updated dependencies [[`2823e81`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/commit/2823e8153ebd084eaa5e165f6fd0963bf4079dd2), [`87bf22a`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/commit/87bf22aeb47e1e08edad373c218ca2a0abd0f9d7)]:

## 1.14.1

### Patch Changes

- [#327](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/pull/327) [`d1e290d`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/commit/d1e290d831c413df3a5622dd915024b2e96c11a0) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an issue with typegen files being sometimes generated when they shouldn't be.

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- [#323](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/pull/323) [`6e524df`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/commit/6e524dfc7b03cd0cea0fcb9df62feaeaa8ae1729) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Upgraded the Babel parser used to analyze the content of the files and machines. This should fix parsing issues with new TS features such as `const` type parameters.

* [#322](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/pull/322) [`cddae40`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/commit/cddae4096bf0a8ff08fec6a816dc1d5ec286ffad) Thanks [@andreash](https://github.com/andreash), [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Introduced a new opt-in option `useDeclarationFileForTypegenData`. It's the recommended way of using this extension and typegen and it fixes compatibility with modern `moduleResolution` options in TypeScript. It can also help you to avoid issues in frameworks that derive pages based on the directory content (such as Nuxt).

  Enabling this might require using at least TypeScript 5.0.

### Patch Changes

- [#82](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/pull/82) [`e49beb2`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/commit/e49beb28551ef11b66a158ad2fcac4a5242edb44) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Fixed a bug where prettier was not found in the server bundle, causing an irrecoverable error on startup.

### Minor Changes

- [`a1c9de6`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/commit/a1c9de6ab1130159da5f59f399869ebbfeaa4281) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Allowed for parsing and rewriting inline implementations in the VSCode extension. This allows you to use either named actions (which were already supported):

  ```ts
  createMachine({
    entry: ['sayHello'],
  });
  ```

  Or inline actions:

  ```ts
  createMachine({
    entry: [
      () => {
        console.log('Hello!');
      },
    ],
  });
  ```

  Both can now be handled in the VSCode extension. This is true for inline actions, services and guards.
