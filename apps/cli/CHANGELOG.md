### Minor Changes

- [#68](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/pull/68) [`9eadb14`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/commit/9eadb143bc16e0a023c89272f5c5cc066f382d3e) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Added a typegen command which allows for running XState's typegen in CLI.

  `xstate typegen "src/**/*.tsx?"`

  Run the typegen against a glob. This will scan every file targeted, and generate a typegen file accompanying it. It will also import the typegen into your file, as described in [our typegen documentation](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/typescript.html#typegen-with-the-vscode-extension).

  > Ensure you wrap your glob in quotes so that it executes correctly. If it isn't wrapped in quotes, it will be interpreted as a list of files, not a glob. This will give unexpected results.

  `xstate typegen "src/**/*.tsx?" --watch`

  Runs the task on a watch, monitoring for changed files and running the typegen script against them.
